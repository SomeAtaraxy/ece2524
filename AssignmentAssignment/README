1. Why is this assignment relevent to an Intro to Unix course?

This assignment is relevant to an Intro to Unix course, because it
expands on the knowledge of the commands that we have already learned
in this class. It allows the students to see that there are simple
solutions to time consuming repetitive tasks.

2. How should points be distributed for this assignment, i.e. what
percentage should go to syntax, style, functionality, content, etc.
If the solution fails to work at all (fails to compile, or fails to run)
how should it be evaluated?

It should be evaluated on the thought that went into the assignment
rather than the solution. There was a point where I could not get all of
the html tags out of the output and almost left them there. I know that
if I could not have solved the problem, I would not have wanted points
to be taken off, because a great deal of effort went into trying to
solve that problem. A nice percent breakdown would be:

20% for having at least a somewhat working solution
40% for assignment idea and having practical uses
30% for having a completed assignment.md file with little to no spelling or grammar errors
10% for completing this README file
