You curse loudly and wildly as a Walker rips out your intestines in front of 
you as you are overpowered and crying out to your brother who is still nowhere
to be found, “Merle! I failed you older brother! I failed you! I didn’t hold up
my end of the deal. Forgive me!” Tears are streaming down your face and realize
your world is ending just months after the Earth started to give way to 
Walkers. With one last shout you yell “Merle! I’ll see you in

THE END
