You think back to the days when it was just you and Merle playing outside while
your parents were inside the trailer arguing while drunk and angry, a lethal
combination you realized even as a young teenager. Full of hope, Merle 
daydreams "When I get the chance, I'm heading as far away from this place as
possible. I'll hit the interstate and drive out to the middle of nowhere and
find a place for you and me. It has to be more pleasant than this God-forsaken
hell-hole."

Instinctively you decide it's best to leave Atlanta and convince yourself your
brother did the same too and is waiting on the other side with a beer and
enough ammo to get you two to that place you both dreamed of 15 years ago.

A long suspension bridge still stands as an exit from the city surrounded by a
river. It is damaged from weather and erosion but it looks stable enough to 
venture across. Dozens of deserted cars sit throughout the bridge and roughly
15 Walkers are feasting upon the corpse of a dead deer. Upon further 
observation you notice an army humvee that may contain some weapons, ammo, and
various food supplies. The risk of going near the Walkers may be warranted by 
the presence of the humvee.
