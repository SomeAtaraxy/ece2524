Outside Atlanta, Georgia
April 4, 2017

Just another perfect day in the suburbs of Atlanta as you and your brother
Merle each down another can of beer as Merle says "Ain't this the life Daryl?"
You couldn't agree more. After an entire weekend of just you and him all over
the country roads of Georgia with nothing but two motorcycles and what seemed
like a never-ending supply of beer, life was good.
