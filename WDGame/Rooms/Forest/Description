[Forest]
A dark and dense forest is due north from your position.
It seems to go on forever and not worth the risk of getting lost
in it. All you see are bushes with berries on it and many nice
walking sticks.  It seems worthless to venture in, but you notice
smoke rising from deep within the forest before you turn away.
