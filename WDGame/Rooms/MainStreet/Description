[MainStreet] 
There are several rotted corpses that lay scattered through the street.
The remaining buildings consist of broken doors, shattered glass, 
and dry blood.  You see a sign dangling from a post that says Main Street.
A cold chill runs down your spine as you realize this once vibrant place
is now full of death and destruction. There is nobody in sight, but you
grip your crossbow on your back to give yourself a sense of protection.
