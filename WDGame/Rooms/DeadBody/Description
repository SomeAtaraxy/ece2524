Was this Merle’s campsite? Did he make it this far? Suddenly your heart starts
racing when you see a body resembling his hanging there lifelessly from a noose
in a nearby tree. You run to it only to realize it was just some other poor 
redneck that decided to give up. “Give up?” That sounds like a good idea as you
think to yourself of a quick escape from this life of death, mourning, and 
struggles to survive. And Walkers. Walkers. You start to grasp your gun 
tighter, tighter and start to stroke the trigger. You pull it up beside your 
head and then BANG!

You bludgeon yourself with the stock and curse at yourself for even considering
giving up on yourself and your brother. There is no way you’re giving up. Your 
mother may have given up even before the Earth was taken by Walkers but you’re 
not making the same mistake she did. You wipe the blood streaming down past 
your right ear, holster your weapon, and head back to the interstate. Despite 
the threat of Walkers hearing and giving away your location, you shout as loud
as possible “I’M COMING FOR YOU MERLE!”
