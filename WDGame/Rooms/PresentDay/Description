Atlanta, Georgia
August 27, 2017

You're suddenly jolted awake by a loud slamming against the closed door on the
opposite side of the alley. You see your crossbow laying a few feet from you
so you stretch to reach it but are met with a sharp, searing pain in your side
Without hesitation you pull the knife from your flesh and rip off your sleeve
to wrap it up. You look up and realize the last thing you remembered was
jumping from a two story fire escape to survive an encounter with a group of
of Walkers; must've fallen on the knife when you fell and passed out from the
pain. You couldn't have been out for more than an hour though as the sun still
hadn't set yet behind the skyscrapers of Atlanta. You examine your surroundings
and thankfully, it's an alley that had tall metal gates surrounding both ends
that kept the Walkers at bay. You ignore the mindless slamming of walkers
behind the shut door and slowly make your way to the far end of the alley. As
you climb the gate that leads to Main Street, you mumble to yourself "I've got
to find Merle; it's been only two days since we got seperated. He IS still
alive."
