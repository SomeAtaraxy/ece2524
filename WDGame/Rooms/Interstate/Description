[Interstate]
You notice that the interstate is just below the hill and that
there are many abandoned cars that look to be in good condition.
Stealing cars from your juvenile years finally pays off since
you can hot wire a car in under 60 seconds. However,
a small group of Walkers linger nearby and will notice
if you make a dash for the car.  It seems dangerous to make
the move, but it would really pay off if successfully accomplished.
