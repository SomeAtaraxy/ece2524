[Campsite]
Going into the forest may have been a good idea afterall, because
you come across an abandoned campsite from tracing the origins
of the smoke.  You have no idea who was here prior to you,
but you see a revolver sitting near the ashes of the once fire
and 2 cans of chicken of the sea tuna.
