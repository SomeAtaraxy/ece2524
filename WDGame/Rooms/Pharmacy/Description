[Pharmacy]
You walk up to a building that looks like it used to be a pharmacy. 
There is no need to open the door since part of the wall has collapsed.
There are still traces of metal scrapes that appears to be from an RPG.
It seems as if there was a battle several months back near this spot.
When you go inside it becomes evident that looters have already taken
many of the supplies. However, you see some medicine, flashlights,
a newspaper, and a radio that loops an emergency signals when it is
turned on.
